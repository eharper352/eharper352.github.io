  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>These last days of summer, we find ourselves stuck inside due to the raging fires that are consuming our lands here in the Pacific Northwest. In a single day, the smoke blew in, creating Fall-like darkness and a haze that mimics Winter’s fog. But we can barely breathe if we venture out of doors, so for the fifth day, we hunker down inside and pray for rain and perhaps a few more days of summer. <br /> <br />With the smoke came a chill in the air, which makes me long for (sooner than I was expecting!) warming meals cooked all day in the slow cooker. A hearty, satisfying white chicken chili recipe is what the day calls for – soothing to both belly and soul.  If you have the time, cook this dish using dried beans in a slow cooker and enjoy the aromas that linger in your kitchen. If time is short, you’re in luck, as you can have this meal ready in mere minutes.

<br /> <br /><em>Versatility tip: Use leftover rotisserie chicken meat, turkey breast, or ground chicken or turkey.</em></p>
